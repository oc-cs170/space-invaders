==============

The program should consist of three modules:

* si.py             - Contains the game loop and runs the game
* ship.py           - A class (Sprite) to create, update, and draw the ship
* invaders.py       - A class (Sprite) to create, update, and draw a single invader
                    - A class (Sprite) to create, update, and draw a single bullet
                    - A class to maintain Groups of invaders and their bullets
